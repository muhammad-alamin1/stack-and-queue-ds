# Stack & Queue DS

* A "stack" is a data structure in CS that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.  
  Imagine a stack of books: you can only remove the book that was most recently placed on top of the  
  stack, and you can only place a new book on top of the stack.

* A "queue" is another data structure in CS, but unlike a stack, it follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.  
  Imagine a queue at a ticket counter: the person who arrives first is the first to be served, and as people arrive,  
  they join the back of the line.
